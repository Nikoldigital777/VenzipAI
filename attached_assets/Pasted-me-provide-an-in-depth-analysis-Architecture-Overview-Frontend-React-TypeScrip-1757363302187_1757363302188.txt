me provide an in-depth analysis:

---

## **Architecture Overview**

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite, using modern patterns like hooks, TanStack Query for state management, and Wouter for routing.

**Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript with Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL, featuring modular route structure and comprehensive API endpoints.

**Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless hosting, extensive schema covering compliance frameworks, tasks, risks, documents, and chat.

**AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API for intelligent compliance analysis, document processing, and chat assistance.

## **Key Components Analysis**

**Frontend Architecture**

- **Modern React Patterns**: Functional components with hooks, TypeScript for type safety
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS with custom Venzip branding and glassmorphism effects
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, local state with useState/useEffect
- **Component Structure**: Well-organized with separate UI components, page components, and business logic hooks

**Backend Architecture**

- **Modular Routes**: Main routes.ts with separate task routes, clean separation of concerns
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration with session management
- **Database Layer**: storage.ts abstracts database operations, Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
- **AI Services**: Comprehensive Anthropic integration in anthropic.ts

### **Database Schema**

The schema is exceptionally comprehensive with 20+ tables covering:

**Core Entities**:

- Users, companies, frameworks, tasks, documents, risks
- Chat messages, notifications, vendor assessments

**Advanced Features**:

- Evidence mappings for compliance tracking
- Cross-framework mappings for requirement relationships
- Risk score history for trend analysis
- Learning resources and progress tracking
- Audit logs for compliance trail

### Identified Issues (Fixed)

Critical Error

There's a JavaScript error in the AI chat component:

```
ReferenceError: Can't find variable: Target

```

This appears to be in the quickPrompts array where `Target` icon is referenced but not imported.

client/src/components/ai-chat.tsx

Fix missing Target icon import
