That’s a really good instinct — right now your flow jumps around (landing → checklist → dashboard → random tabs), which feels confusing to both auditors and business users.
What you need is a clear information architecture (IA):
🧭 Recommended Page Organization (MVP)
0. Landing / Marketing (Public)
Landing.tsx
Purpose: explain product, pricing, contact.
CTA: “Start Onboarding” (goes to /onboarding).
This should not directly dump into compliance tasks/checklists.
1. Onboarding (Private Workspace Setup)
OnboardingWizard.tsx (multi-step as we designed above).
Steps: Welcome → Company Profile → Frameworks → Task Preview → AI Assistant → Summary.
On completion: redirect to /dashboard.
2. Main App (After Onboarding)
Use sidebar nav (left tabs) with a fixed order:
Dashboard (Dashboard.tsx)
High-level metrics, progress rings, risk heatmap.
Entry point after onboarding.
Tasks (Tasks.tsx)
List all framework-linked tasks.
Filters: framework, status, category.
Evidence (Evidence.tsx)
Uploaded docs linked to tasks/controls.
Status: pending/verified.
Frameworks (Frameworks.tsx)
List of frameworks selected in onboarding.
Progress per framework (% tasks completed).
Risks (Risks.tsx)
Heatmap + risk register.
Pulls from task statuses for MVP.
Documents (Documents.tsx)
Central repository of all uploaded files.
Linked back to Evidence.
Audit Calendar (AuditCalendar.tsx)
Simple event view: deadlines, renewals, audits.
AI Chat (AIChat.tsx)
Conversational assistant.
Compliance Insights (ComplianceInsights.tsx)
Automated gap analysis & narrative generation.
Company Profile (CompanyProfile.tsx)
Settings page with editable company details.
3. Reporting & Exports
Reports.tsx
Generate PDF exports (company profile, frameworks, tasks, evidence, dashboards).
Place this under Dashboard’s “Export” button.
🔄 Flow (User Journey)
Visitor → Landing Page
Reads about product → clicks “Start Onboarding.”
Onboarding Wizard (Guided Setup)
Company info → Frameworks → Tasks → AI → Done.
Redirect to Dashboard
See compliance health instantly (0% filled, but real data structure created).
From Dashboard → Explore Tabs
Evidence, Risks, AI Chat, etc.
📊 Why This Works
Landing = Marketing
Onboarding = Guided Setup
Dashboard = Hub (no more dropping users into a checklist randomly).
Sidebar Nav = Orderly IA → dashboards → workflows → intelligence → settings.
🛠️ Implementation To-Dos
Move checklist.tsx content → integrate into Tasks.tsx.
Create Sidebar.tsx layout → wrap all app routes after onboarding.
Redirect:
/ → Landing
/onboarding → Wizard
/dashboard → Authenticated app hub.
