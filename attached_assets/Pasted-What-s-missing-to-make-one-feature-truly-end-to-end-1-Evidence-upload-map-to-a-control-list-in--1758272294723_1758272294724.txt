What’s missing to make one feature truly end-to-end
1) Evidence upload → map to a control → list in UI (recommended single E2E feature)
Why this one? It’s the smallest slice that still shows real value for ISO-27001 or HIPAA: user selects a framework, uploads a doc, it’s stored, recorded, mapped to a specific control (e.g., ISO A.9.2.1 or HIPAA 164.312(a)(1)), then appears in the Evidence/Documents list.
Gaps
No server endpoints for documents/evidence. The plan calls for /api/documents but I don’t see a concrete route implementation yet (only an upload config write-up).

Unknown/uncertain DB schema for documents/evidence. The README says there are tables for documents, but the actual @shared/schema file isn’t visible in the excerpts; we can’t confirm columns. If these tables/columns aren’t defined, you’ll need to add them.

Client <FileUpload /> is mounted but not wired (no fetch to the upload endpoint; Documents list is a static placeholder). 
Nikoldigital777_VenzipAI (1)
No listing API to show uploaded artifacts with pagination/filters (you do have reusable pagination helpers). 
Nikoldigital777_VenzipAI (1)
No chain-of-custody fields (hash, uploader, createdAt/version) to satisfy even minimal ISO/HIPAA “auditability” expectations in the evidence model (your workflow doc calls this out as desired behavior). 
Features Workflow
What to add (minimal, production-sane)
Drizzle schema (if missing):
documents (or evidence) table with at least:
id, companyId, frameworkId, requirementId, filename, mimeType, size, storagePathOrUrl, sha256, status('pending'|'verified'|'rejected'), version, uploaderUserId, createdAt.
(Status + version map to your Evidence DoD and quality gates.) 
Features Workflow
Server routes (Express):
POST /api/documents (Multer single upload). Validates frameworkId, requirementId, computes SHA-256, stores to uploads/ (or GCS later), inserts row in documents. (Your upload write-up already specifies Multer + local storage and acceptable types). 
Nikoldigital777_VenzipAI (1)
GET /api/documents?frameworkId=&requirementId=&status=&limit=&offset= to return a paginated list using your documentFilterSchema and pagination helpers. 
Nikoldigital777_VenzipAI (1)
Optionally PATCH /api/documents/:id/status for manual verification in early MVP.
Client:
Wire <FileUpload /> to POST /api/documents and surface upload progress + success state in the Documents page. Then render the list from GET /api/documents (use TanStack Query; your QueryClient is already configured). 
Nikoldigital777_VenzipAI (1)
When the user is on a framework/control detail, prefill frameworkId + requirementId into the upload payload so artifacts are mapped on arrival (aligns to your “link evidence → control(s)” goal). 
Features Workflow
Acceptance test (for demo):
Select ISO-27001 in onboarding, navigate to Documents, upload a PDF for A.9.2.1; see it appear in the list and in the control’s evidence panel.
Refresh; item is persisted with name, size, hash, timestamp, and status pending.
(Stretch) Toggle a “mark as verified” admin action → status changes to verified.
