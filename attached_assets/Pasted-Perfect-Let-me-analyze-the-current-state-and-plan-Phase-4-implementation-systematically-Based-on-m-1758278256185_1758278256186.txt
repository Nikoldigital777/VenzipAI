Perfect! Let me analyze the current state and plan Phase 4 implementation systematically. Based on my examination of the codebase, here's what I found:

Current State Analysis:
1. ‚ùå Compliance % Calculation Problem (Lines 625-642 in server/routes.ts):

// Current calculation only counts uploaded documents
const bonus = Math.min(35, documents.length * 2 + Math.floor(chatMessagesData.length / 3));
Issue: documents.length only includes manually uploaded files
Missing: Generated policies are NOT counted toward compliance percentage
2. ‚ùå Evidence Dashboard Gap (evidence-mapping-dashboard.tsx):

Fetches from /api/evidence/mappings but may not include policy mappings
Shows uploaded files but potentially missing system-generated policies
3. ‚úÖ Infrastructure Ready (From Phase 2):

policyEvidenceMapper creates document entries for policies ‚úÖ
Creates evidence mappings linking policies to controls ‚úÖ
But these aren't surfacing in compliance calculations ‚ùå
Phase 4: Complete Evidence Integration Plan
Task 5a: Include Generated Policies in Compliance % Calculation
Problem: Compliance score ignores generated policies
Fix: Update /api/summary endpoint to include policy contributions

Implementation:

// Current (server/routes.ts:628)
const bonus = documents.length * 2 + Math.floor(chatMessages.length / 3);
// Should be:  
const policyDocuments = await storage.getGeneratedPolicies(company.id);
const totalEvidence = documents.length + policyDocuments.length;
const bonus = totalEvidence * 2 + Math.floor(chatMessages.length / 3);
Task 5b: Show Policies in Evidence Mapping Dashboard
Problem: Evidence dashboard doesn't display policy mappings
Fix: Update evidence mappings query to include policy-generated evidence

Implementation:

// Update /api/evidence/mappings to include policy mappings
// Filter evidence_mappings table to include policy documents
Task 5c: Update Coverage Indicators
Problem: Framework progress doesn't count policy coverage
Fix: Include policy evidence in coverage calculations

Areas to Update:

Framework progress calculations
Evidence coverage percentages
Control completion tracking
Expected MVP Demo Flow After Phase 4:
‚úÖ Onboarding ‚Üí Framework Selection (ISO 27001/HIPAA)
‚úÖ Auto-generate baseline policy (12-page professional document)  
‚úÖ Policy automatically mapped to controls as evidence
‚úÖ Dashboard shows "Your ISO 27001 Information Security Policy - Ready"
‚úÖ Documents page lists generated policies + uploaded evidence
üéØ Compliance % includes policy coverage (NEW)
üéØ Evidence dashboard shows policies as mapped evidence (NEW)  
üéØ Coverage indicators reflect policy contributions (NEW)
‚úÖ Download policy as professional document
Implementation Priority:
Fix compliance calculation (highest impact - immediately shows value)
Update evidence mappings display (visibility in evidence dashboard)
Update coverage indicators (complete integration)
