# Development Plan for Week 2 Features:

For an MVP, let me focus on the most essential features that deliver immediate value without over-engineering.

ðŸš€Â **MVP Dynamic Risk Scoring Engine**

Let me streamline this to the core features that matter most for your MVP:

**Phase 1: Essential Automated Risk Calculations**Â (Day 1)

**What users need most**: Risk scores that update automatically when they complete tasks

**Core Implementation:**

1. **Auto-trigger on task completion**Â - Risk recalculates when tasks are marked done
2. **Overdue task detection**Â - Automatically weight overdue tasks more heavily
3. **Simple daily score updates**Â - Background job runs once daily to refresh all scores

**Phase 2: Basic Real-time Updates**Â (Day 1-2)

**What users need most**: See immediate impact when they complete work

**Core Implementation:**

1. **Simple score refresh**Â - Page updates risk score after task actions
2. **Visual feedback**Â - Clear before/after score display
3. **Basic trend indicator**Â - Simple up/down arrow with percentage change

**Phase 3: Smart Alerting**Â (Day 2)

**What users need most**: Know when risks are getting dangerous

**Core Implementation:**

1. **Critical threshold alerts**Â - Notify when risk score hits dangerous levels (80%+)
2. **Overdue task warnings**Â - Alert when high-impact tasks become overdue
3. **In-app notifications only**Â - Keep it simple, no email complexity

**MVP Deliverables:**

- âœ… Risk scores auto-update when tasks completed
- âœ… Overdue tasks automatically increase risk scores
- âœ… Simple trend indicators (improving/declining/stable)
- âœ… Critical risk alerts (80%+ score)
- âœ… Basic risk explanation from Claude

**Skip for MVP:**

- Complex forecasting and predictive modeling
- Advanced trend analysis with charts
- Multi-channel notifications
- Peer benchmarking
- WebSocket real-time updates

This gives users the core value -Â **automatic risk scoring that responds to their actions**Â - without the complexity. Perfect for validating the concept before building more advanced features.
